/// values `n = 0` to `39`. However, when `n = 40`, `40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1)
/// + 41` is divisible by `41`, and certainly when `n = 41`, `41^2 + 41 + 41` is
/// clearly divisible by `41`.
///
/// The incredible formula `n^2 - 79n + 1601` was discovered, which produces 80
/// primes for the consecutive values `n = 0` to `79`. The product of the
