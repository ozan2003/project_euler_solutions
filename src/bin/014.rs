/// # Longest Collatz sequence

/// n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)
///
/// Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following
/// sequence:
///
/// 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
///
/// It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1)
/// contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it
/// is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
///
/// Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
///
/// NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
